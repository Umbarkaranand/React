**Smart Parking System** is administered by an administrator and accessible to users through a web application from any location. This system allows users to remotely check parking availability in real-time. It enhances convenience by eliminating the need for physical presence at parking facilities and provides users with up-to-date information to make informed decisions. Additionally, the system likely features a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and accessibility. Overall, it offers a convenient and efficient solution for managing parking spaces effectively.
Administrator Signup: The administrator visits the smart parking system website. They navigate to the signup page and fill in their details such as username, email, and password. After submitting the signup form, the system verifies the information and creates a new administrator account. Administrator Login: Upon successful signup, the administrator proceeds to the login page. They enter their username and password to authenticate their identity. If the credentials are correct, the system grants access to the administrator dashboard. 
Parking Registration: From the dashboard, the administrator navigates to the parking registration section. They fill in the required information for each parking slot, including parking name, number, and availability status. Once all details are provided, the administrator submits the registration form. The system validates the information and registers the parking slots in the database. 
Main Parking Dashboard: After registration, the administrator is redirected to the main parking dashboard. Here, they can view all registered parking slots along with their current availability status. The administrator has the ability to change the availability status of each parking slot (e.g., from "filled" to "vacant" and vice versa) as per the actual occupancy. 
User Access: Users (parking seekers) access the smart parking system website without the need for authentication. They land on the homepage or parking search page, where they can view a list of available parking slots. Users can search for parking slots based on location, availability, or other criteria. Upon selecting a parking slot, users can view detailed information such as parking name, number, and real-time availability status. 
Real-time Updates: As the administrator changes the availability status of parking slots from the dashboard, these updates are reflected in real-time on the user interface. Users can see the current availability status of parking slots without the need for refreshing the page. This workflow ensures a seamless experience for both administrators and users, facilitating efficient parking management and accessibility.

**TECHNOLOGY USED IN SMART PARKING : **

MongoDB: MongoDB remains the same in the MERN stack. It's a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. MongoDB is known for its scalability, high performance, and flexibility, making it suitable for various types of applications.

Express.js: Express.js is also a part of the MERN stack. It's a minimalist web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. Express.js simplifies the process of building APIs and handling HTTP requests and responses on the server-side.

React: React is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It's used for building dynamic single-page web applications (SPAs). React provides a component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and JSX syntax, making it easier to build reusable and interactive UI components. React is highly efficient and scalable, making it a popular choice for front-end development in the MERN stack.

Node.js: Node.js remains the same in the MERN stack as well. It's a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for building scalable and high-performance web servers. In the MERN stack, Node.js is used with Express.js to handle server-side logic and APIs.
