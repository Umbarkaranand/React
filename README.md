TITLE: Smart Parking Management

INTRODUCTION:
As urbanization continues to surge and city traffic becomes increasingly congested, finding parking in urban areas has become a major challenge, exacerbated by the post-COVID surge in road traffic. Public transportation may not always be accessible to everyone, and parking personal vehicles can be both difficult and expensive. Consequently, the demand for a web-based smart parking system has become more urgent, aiming to alleviate traffic congestion and provide predictability in parking availability.
The transition from an IoT-based parking system to a web application involves leveraging connected devices and online platforms to facilitate parking management. By harnessing the power of web technologies, such as real-time data processing and user-friendly interfaces, municipalities and parking operators can offer users a seamless parking experience. Users can easily access the application through their web browsers, check parking availability in real-time, and reserve parking spaces if necessary. 
Moreover, as urban populations continue to grow according to projections from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), the demand for efficient parking solutions will only increase. By embracing a web-based approach to smart parking, cities can address the pressing challenges of urbanization and provide citizens with a more convenient and sustainable parking experience.
The massive problem with the current parking management 
Research shows that most cars search for parking spots for around 3.5 to 14 minutes. Drivers who lack patience sometimes park illegally and if caught, have to pay hefty fines. In crowded cities, this amounts to a loss of around 470 to 1870 hours looking for car parking. Is the hassle worth it? Absolutely not!

Another research shows that up to 68% of the world's population would reside in urban areas by 2050. As we advance, this will directly affect how drivers park their cars in urban areas. Either we stop purchasing cars or leverage IoT technology to optimize parking slots.

Smart Parking helps to eliminate following problems related to parking : 
1. Overpaying
Sometimes, drivers still determine how long they will stay in a particular location. As a result, they may pay too much for parking while the duration may be much lesser.

2. Environmental impact
Besides time, a lot of fuel is consumed looking for an appropriate parking space. When it rains, numerous pollutants accumulated in the parking lots get a wash, creating dirty, wet mud and foul smells.

3. Parking inappropriately
The parking lot at the mall or the customer's intended destination is usually insufficient and they end up parking outside the designated spot. It results in greater traffic congestion.

4. Overcrowded parking spaces
The biggest issue right now is that there are more cars on the road compared to the parking spots. Talk about bumper-to-bumper traffic!

5. Insufficient parking space utilization
People frequently lack patience or are unaware of parking slot availability. They tend to park improperly due to the rush. Occasionally, they may not leave enough room for other vehicles to park. These lead to traffic blockages.
SMART PARKING SYSTEM. THE MODERN TREND OR A GROWING NEED?
Parking problems are not uncommon, especially for big cities. By 2023, market spending for smart parking products and services is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% and surpass $3.8B according to an IoT Analytics report. The growth of market spending is good news because it will force people to try to find a solution to these traffic problems instead of taking no action.
WORKING FLOW OF SMART PARKING SYSTEM : 
Our Smart Parking System is administered by an administrator and accessible to users through a web application from any location. This system allows users to remotely check parking availability in real-time. It enhances convenience by eliminating the need for physical presence at parking facilities and provides users with up-to-date information to make informed decisions. Additionally, the system likely features a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and accessibility. Overall, it offers a convenient and efficient solution for managing parking spaces effectively.
Administrator Signup: The administrator visits the smart parking system website. They navigate to the signup page and fill in their details such as username, email, and password. After submitting the signup form, the system verifies the information and creates a new administrator account. Administrator Login: Upon successful signup, the administrator proceeds to the login page. They enter their username and password to authenticate their identity. If the credentials are correct, the system grants access to the administrator dashboard. 
Parking Registration: From the dashboard, the administrator navigates to the parking registration section. They fill in the required information for each parking slot, including parking name, number, and availability status. Once all details are provided, the administrator submits the registration form. The system validates the information and registers the parking slots in the database. 
Main Parking Dashboard: After registration, the administrator is redirected to the main parking dashboard. Here, they can view all registered parking slots along with their current availability status. The administrator has the ability to change the availability status of each parking slot (e.g., from "filled" to "vacant" and vice versa) as per the actual occupancy. 
User Access: Users (parking seekers) access the smart parking system website without the need for authentication. They land on the homepage or parking search page, where they can view a list of available parking slots. Users can search for parking slots based on location, availability, or other criteria. Upon selecting a parking slot, users can view detailed information such as parking name, number, and real-time availability status. 
Real-time Updates: As the administrator changes the availability status of parking slots from the dashboard, these updates are reflected in real-time on the user interface. Users can see the current availability status of parking slots without the need for refreshing the page. This workflow ensures a seamless experience for both administrators and users, facilitating efficient parking management and accessibility.
TECHNOLOGY USED IN SMART PARKING : 
MongoDB: MongoDB remains the same in the MERN stack. It's a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. MongoDB is known for its scalability, high performance, and flexibility, making it suitable for various types of applications.
Express.js: Express.js is also a part of the MERN stack. It's a minimalist web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. Express.js simplifies the process of building APIs and handling HTTP requests and responses on the server-side.
React: React is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It's used for building dynamic single-page web applications (SPAs). React provides a component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and JSX syntax, making it easier to build reusable and interactive UI components. React is highly efficient and scalable, making it a popular choice for front-end development in the MERN stack.
Node.js: Node.js remains the same in the MERN stack as well. It's a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for building scalable and high-performance web servers. In the MERN stack, Node.js is used with Express.js to handle server-side logic and APIs.
Together, MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js form the MERN stack, providing developers with a powerful set of tools for building modern full-stack web applications. MERN stack applications are known for their flexibility, scalability, and real-time capabilities, making them suitable for a wide range of projects.
